<h4>This project shows a sample workaround of how to perfectly load images from a paged api into android app using search query along with caching into 
  local database for offline usage. This app uses <a href="https://pixabay.com/">PIXABAY</a> photo search API as an online photo library. Below you can find a stack of
  technologies that have been used to develop this application. All features that the app currently have are also listed below along with the future improvement targets.</h4>
