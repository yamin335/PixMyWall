<h4>This project shows a sample workaround of how to perfectly load images from a paged api into android app using search query along with caching into 
  local database for offline usage. This app uses <a href="https://pixabay.com/">PIXABAY</a> photo search API as an online photo library. Below you can find a stack of
  technologies that have been used to develop this application. All features that the app currently have are also listed below along with the future improvement targets. To build and run the project please follow the guidelines below, because you can get errors due to the different configurations of Android Studio.</h4>
